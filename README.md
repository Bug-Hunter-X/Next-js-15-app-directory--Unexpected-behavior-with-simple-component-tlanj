# Next.js 15 App Directory Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Next.js 15's App directory when using a very simple component.

## Bug Description

When creating a simple component in the `pages` directory, it does not render as expected within the App directory structure.  This issue might be related to how Next.js 15 handles routing or component loading in the new directory structure.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.

Observe that the page renders unexpectedly (it might not render at all or render with errors).

## Solution

This example demonstrates a basic functional component.  This is a minimal reproducible example.  The solution might depend on the specific context of your application and the exact nature of the unexpected behavior.
